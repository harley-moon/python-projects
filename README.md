# python-projects
Coursework completed in 2020 as a requirement for my Master of Library and Information Science degree. This course included lab assignments which were completed independently to gain firsthand experience using Python for:
* data acquisition through APIs, web services, and relational databases
* data cleaning and storage methods including redundancy checks, integrity validation, and database formatting
* data analysis, modeling, visualization, and metadata processing

Additionally, this course covered fundamental concepts of programming such as data types, data structures, control flow, looping, and routine task automation with scripting.
