#### [Lab_04:](https://github.com/harley-moon/python-projects/blob/main/Lab_04.ipynb) 
Creation of a gradebook repository and use of logic to determine the highest average and the highest single score.
#### [Lab_05:](https://github.com/harley-moon/python-projects/blob/main/Lab_05.ipynb) 
Addition of data to the gradebook repository and use of logic to compute students’ weighted grades for the semester.
#### [Lab_06:](https://github.com/harley-moon/python-projects/blob/main/Lab_06.ipynb) 
Addition of grade data, calculation of current grades using the weighted average, and prediction of what students’ grades on the next assignment will need to be to achieve different letter grades (A+, A, A-, B+, etc.). 
#### [Lab_07:](https://github.com/harley-moon/python-projects/blob/main/Lab_07.ipynb)
Use of pandas (data analysis/manipulation package) to create a data frame of the gradebook repository for more robust statistical analysis. Addition of columns to the data frame and transposition of the gradebook on its side to add aggregated cumulative data such as student averages.
#### [Lab_08:](https://github.com/harley-moon/python-projects/blob/main/Lab_08.ipynb)
Additional pandas exploration and use of data frames to perform statistical analyses and gain insights into student performance. Computes GPA information as well as some final grade statistics.
#### [Lab_09:](https://github.com/harley-moon/python-projects/blob/main/Lab_09.ipynb)
Addition of columns and statistical analyses to the gradebook data frame, including t-test, z-score, regression analysis, ANOVA test, and post-hoc test. Use of Matplotlib (data visualization package) to create scatter plot visualizations of these statistics.
#### [Lab_10:](https://github.com/harley-moon/python-projects/blob/main/Lab_10.ipynb)
Use of Matplotlib to create a bar chart displaying the average and standard deviation of assignment scores, a line graph showing assignment scores for two semesters, and a pie chart of final letter grade distribution.
