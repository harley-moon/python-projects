    "For this question, we are going to project what the final project 4 grade needs to be for specific grades if _we assume the average for the labs **is the same** as the average for the first 5 labs.  To perform this caluclation, you need to get the total grade so far, using the same weightings used in lab 5.  We should calculate the necessary grade for an A+ (97% or better) A (93% - 96.9%), A- (90% - 92.9%), B+ (87% - 89.9%), and B (83% - 86.9%).  If it is not possible to earn a grade, given current scores and the projected average of the labs, indicate the grade is not possible.\n",
